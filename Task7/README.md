# Java Script Notes
1. Variables (let & const)
Definition: Used to declare variables. let allows reassignment, while const does not.
2. Data Types
Definition: Data types define the kind of value stored in a variable. JavaScript has primitive and reference data types.
3. Truthy & Falsy Values
Definition: Values that are automatically treated as true or false when evaluated in a condition.
4. Operators
Definition: Special symbols used to perform operations like comparison, logical checks, and calculations.
5. Conditional Statements
Definition: Used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.
# Functions
1. Function Declaration & Expression
Definition: A reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task.
2. Arrow Functions
Definition: A shorter and cleaner syntax for writing functions.
3. Default Parameters
Definition: Parameters that take a default value when no argument is provided.
4. Return Values
Definition: Used to send a result back from a function to the caller.
# Objects & Arrays
1. Object Creation & Access
Definition: Objects store data in key-value pairs.
2. Array Basics
Definition: Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.
3. Array Methods
Definition: Built-in functions used to process and manipulate arrays.
# Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
1. Destructuring
Definition: A syntax used to extract values from objects or arrays easily.
2. Spread Operator
Definition: Used to copy or combine values from arrays or objects.
3. Rest Operator
Definition: Used to collect multiple values into a single parameter.
4. Template Literals
Definition: A modern way to create strings with embedded expressions.
# Modules & Classes
1. import / export
Definition: Used to share variables, functions, or classes between files.
2. ES6 Classes
Definition: A blueprint used to create objects with properties and methods.
3. Constructor
Definition: A special method that runs automatically when an object is created.
4. extends & super
Definition: Keywords used to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.
5. this Keyword
Definition: Refers to the current object instance.
# Asynchronous JavaScript
1. Callbacks
Definition: A function passed as an argument to another function to be executed later.
2. Promises
Definition: An object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
3. async / await
Definition: Syntax that makes asynchronous code easier to read and write.
4. try...catch
Definition: Used to handle runtime errors gracefully.
# Advanced JavaScript
1. Scope
Definition: Determines where variables are accessible in the code.
2. Closures
Definition: A feature where an inner function remembers variables from its outer function.
3. Immutability
Definition: The practice of not modifying original data but creating new copies instead.
4. Higher-Order Functions
Definition: Functions that accept other functions as arguments or return them.
# Browser & Rutime
1. DOM Basics
Definition: The DOM allows JavaScript to access and manipulate HTML elements.
2. Event Handling
Definition: The process of responding to user interactions like clicks or key presses.
3. Event Bubbling
Definition: A process where events propagate from child elements to parent elements.
4. LocalStorage & SessionStorage
Definition: Browser storage mechanisms used to store data locally.
5. JSON
Definition: A lightweight data format used for storing and exchanging data.
